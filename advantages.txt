1. The Core Advantages

Speed: Move from monthly releases to daily (or hourly) deployments.

Consistency: A pipeline runs the exact same script every time. It eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem.

Auditability: Every change, build, and deployment is logged. You know exactly who deployed what and when.

2. The Guardrails: Why "Red" is Good

The "Fail Fast" Mechanism:

We want bugs to break the Pipeline, not the Production Server.

If a test fails, the pipeline stops immediately (The Guardrail).

Automated Gates:

Linting: Stops messy/non-standard code.

Unit Tests: Stops logic errors.

Security Scans: Stops vulnerabilities.

3. Live Demo Scenario

Objective: We will commit "bad code" to the repository.

Expectation: The CI pipeline will detect the error, fail the job, and prevent the code from moving to the Deployment stage.
